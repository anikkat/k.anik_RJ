left,Refik Anadol,001,"Refik Anadol, born in 1985 in Istanbul, Turkey, is an internationally recognized media artist and director, known for his work in the aesthetics of machine intelligence. Based in Los Angeles, California, he leads Refik Anadol Studio and RAS LAB, both dedicated to exploring innovative approaches to data narratives. Anadol also serves as a faculty member at UCLA’s Department of Design Media Arts, where he completed his Master of Fine Arts.

His artistic endeavors examine the implications of ubiquitous computing on human identity and the human condition in the age of artificial intelligence. He investigates how digital technologies and machine learning reshape our perceptions of time and space, focusing on creating immersive environments that alter the conventional understanding of space.",01.jpeg,,"Renaissance Dreams — Palazzo Strozzi, 2022",,https://refikanadol.com/, 
left,"Can’t Help Myself, Sun Yuan and Peng Yu",002,"Commissioned for the Guggenheim Museum, Sun Yuan & Peng Yu's installation features an industrial robot armed with visual-recognition sensors and a custom shovel, encapsulated within acrylic walls. Tasked with containing a deep-red liquid within a set boundary, the robot frenetically reacts when sensors detect any deviation, shoveling the fluid back and leaving behind chaotic smudges and splashes. This work examines our increasingly automated reality, questioning the roles of control and vulnerability between humans and machines. The artists’ use of dark humor through the robot’s repetitive, Sisyphean task also critiques contemporary issues of migration, sovereignty, and the authoritarian use of technology to enforce boundaries.",02.jpeg,,"Can’t Help Myself, 2016",,https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/34812/,
left,Haus-Rucker-Co,003,"Haus-Rucker-Co, a Viennese collective established in 1967 by Laurids Ortner, Günther Zamp Kelp, and Klaus Pinter, with later addition Manfred Ortner, delved into the performative and experimental potential of architecture. Their projects, characterized by pneumatic structures and sensory-altering prosthetic devices, aimed to transform perceptions of space and engage viewers as active participants. This innovative approach placed them among the avant-garde architectural groups of the 1960s, such as Superstudio, Archizoom, Ant Farm, and Coop Himmelblau, who shared utopian and critical visions for architecture. The Mind Expander series from 1967-69, including devices like the 'Fly Head' helmet, distorted sensory perceptions, offering a new reality and critiquing the restrictive bourgeois lifestyle.

left,Moon Ribas,004,"A Catalan cyborg artist, Moon Ribas is renowned for developing the Seismic Sense, an innovative seismic sensor that enables her to feel earthquakes occurring globally through real-time vibrations. Ribas translates this unique sensory experience into artistic performances, where she interprets Earth's seismic activity either through sound in 'Seismic Percussion' or dance in 'Waiting For Earthquakes,' with the Earth serving as both composer and choreographer. Additionally, her seismic sense extends to feeling moonquakes, allowing her to experience seismic activities on the Moon. Ribas advocates for extending human perception beyond Earth to become 'senstronauts,' experiencing both Earth and space simultaneously.",04.jpeg,,"A Catalan cyborg artist, Moon Ribas",,https://www.cyborgarts.com/moon-ribas,

left,Schemas of Uncertainty,006,"Schemas of Uncertainty' is a research project that explores the connections between prediction and prescription in contemporary socio-political contexts. The project delves into the risks and opportunities that emerging technologies present for envisioning alternative futures or realities. It spans a range of predictive practices from ancient divination to modern machine learning, examining the potential and challenges at the frontiers of what can be known. The project views uncertainty not as a barrier, but as a productive state that can foster new forms of social interaction and collective imagination.",06.jpeg,,"Schemas of Uncertainty, landing page",,https://schemasofuncertainty.com/null,

left,Reaction-Diffusion by Zaron Chen,010,"Reaction-Diffusion' by Zaron Chen, similar to Naoki Tsutae's 'Grid Spreading,' is an interactive sketch that responds to mouse clicks. Unlike the chaotic ripples of Tsutae's work, Chen's sketch evokes a chemical or melting sensation, offering a more subdued interaction. Additionally, it features customisable controls that allow users to alter effects, providing a unique experience of manipulating what feels like a fluid, reactive substance.",10.jpeg,,Reaction-Diffusion sourced from OpenProcessing,,https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2186619/,
